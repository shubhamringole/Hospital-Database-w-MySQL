ðŸŒŸ Exciting Project Showcase! ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest project: a comprehensive Hospital Database built on MySQL! This project has been a labor of love, focusing on efficient data management and organization for hospital records. It includes features like patient management, appointment scheduling, and inventory tracking, all designed to improve healthcare operations.

A huge thank you to shubham ingole for the inspiring content and guidance that made this project possible. Your tutorials provided the foundational knowledge I needed to bring this project to life!
